# arduino visualiser
recently i took part in the SoME1 math video contest, and although i didn't get a prize, the videos made for the competition were AMAZING. like all of them were so high quality.

some of them were about Bezier Curves, some about Fourier Transforms, and a LOT more found here which are just utterly beautiful. in particular, i was more attracted to the fourier transform videos.

[this one by Mr Water Gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToMyB5Hk06w) and [this one by Peter Gilliam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eayo7pZ2g7A) were the ones that gave me a "woah" moment.

actually, i've watched [3b1b's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) on the topic some time ago, and i had an idea to make an Arduino visualiser myself, to light up different colors in response to different frequencies, but i was kinda dumb back then and thought it would be easy, so eventually past me gave up Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

the fourier transform videos from SoME rekindled the project in my heart, and with some time to spare, i thought why not start a new side project? so i started looking into FFT algorithms, and realised that the same problem has ben solved by many people in the past, so i decided to use the [arduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT/) library for it instead. 

i won't be going into how the algorithm works (definitely not because idk how it works), but there are a lot of useful resources online ([SoME playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQX-jgAF5pTkwtUuVpqS5tuWmJ-6ZM-Z))

# starting grounds
during my discovery, i found [this blog tutorial by Norwegian Creations](https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2017/08/what-is-fft-and-how-can-you-implement-it-on-an-arduino/), which had some code to analyze frequencies from a signal generator, so i copied it over and used that as my starting point.

```arduino
#include "arduinoFFT.h"
 
#define SAMPLES 128             //Must be a power of 2
#define SAMPLING_FREQUENCY 1000 //Hz, must be less than 10000 due to ADC
 
arduinoFFT FFT = arduinoFFT();
 
unsigned int sampling_period_us;
unsigned long microseconds;
 
double vReal[SAMPLES];
double vImag[SAMPLES];
 
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
 
    sampling_period_us = round(1000000*(1.0/SAMPLING_FREQUENCY));
}
 
void loop() {
   
    /*SAMPLING*/
    for(int i=0; i<SAMPLES; i++)
    {
        microseconds = micros();    //Overflows after around 70 minutes!
     
        vReal[i] = analogRead(0);
        vImag[i] = 0;
     
        while(micros() < (microseconds + sampling_period_us)){
        }
    }
 
    /*FFT*/
    FFT.Windowing(vReal, SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);
    FFT.Compute(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES, FFT_FORWARD);
    FFT.ComplexToMagnitude(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES);
    double peak = FFT.MajorPeak(vReal, SAMPLES, SAMPLING_FREQUENCY);
 
    /*PRINT RESULTS*/
    //Serial.println(peak);     //Print out what frequency is the most dominant.
 
    for(int i=0; i<(SAMPLES/2); i++)
    {
        /*View all these three lines in serial terminal to see which frequencies has which amplitudes*/
         
        //Serial.print((i * 1.0 * SAMPLING_FREQUENCY) / SAMPLES, 1);
        //Serial.print(" ");
        Serial.println(vReal[i], 1);    //View only this line in serial plotter to visualize the bins
    }
 
    //delay(1000);  //Repeat the process every second OR:
    while(1);       //Run code once
}
```
i hooked up an Arduino UNO and a MAX9814 mic module to test it out, and it worked smoothly ðŸ˜Ž
![mic setup](/static/arduino-visualiser/mic.jpg)

the blog post highlights some key stuff about FFT:
- sampling frequency
- number of samples
- bins

## sampling frequency
by something called the [Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem), to sample a signal using discrete timesteps, the **sampling frequency must be at least twice the signal's frequency**. 
basically, for each signal you want to measure, you need to be at least 2 times faster than the signal's period, in other words:
$$
freq_{max} = \frac{1}{2} freq_{sample}
$$
looking at the Arduino UNO, a standard `analogRead` function takes about $100\mu\text{s}$ - that means the time between each sampling period must be at least $100\mu\text{s}$:
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{freq_{sample}\text{Hz}} \cdot 1000000\frac{\mu\text{s}}{\text{s}} &> 100\mu\text{s} \\
freq_{sample} &< 10000\text{Hz} 
\end{aligned}
$$
but this calculation may differ for different MCUs.

## number of samples
this must be $2^n$, because of the library :P

(i think) 1 sample takes around 8 bytes, but idk lol

and obviously, $\text{samples} \propto \frac{1}{\text{algo speed}} \propto \text{resolution}$

## bins
bins are just the result of the FFT, and represents 1 element of the resulting array

here's a diagram explaning what each FFT outputs:
![diagram](/static/arduino-visualiser/diagram.png)

![serial plotter graph](/static/arduino-visualiser/com.png)
there was a huge spike around the 0th and 1st datapoint though, so i just set them equal to 0:
```arduino
/*FFT*/
FFT.Windowing(vReal, SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);
FFT.Compute(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES, FFT_FORWARD);
FFT.ComplexToMagnitude(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES);
double peak = FFT.MajorPeak(vReal, SAMPLES, SAMPLING_FREQUENCY);

/*PRINT RESULTS*/
//Serial.println(peak);     //Print out what frequency is the most dominant.

vReal[0] = 0; // idk why these are here but i'll just
vReal[1] = 0; // remove these spikes for now
```

Norwegian Creations has another [follow-up blog post](https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/) too, which i recommend checking out ðŸ‘€
# adding a display
since it ran smoothly now, my next step was to attach a display to show the detected frequencies - i had a spare 128x32 OLED lying around, so i thought this was the perfect project to use it in.
![128x32 OLED](/static/arduino-visualiser/128x32.jpg)

after some tinkering (copy-pasting), i got the thing to display frequencies:
(i changed the samples to 64 because of memory issues + set the delay to 1ms)
```arduino
// -------------------- FFT SETUP --------------------
#include "arduinoFFT.h" 
#define SAMPLES 64             //Must be a power of 2
#define SAMPLING_FREQUENCY 1000 //Hz, must be less than 10000 due to ADC
 
arduinoFFT FFT = arduinoFFT();
 
unsigned int sampling_period_us;
unsigned long microseconds;

double vReal[SAMPLES];
double vImag[SAMPLES];

// -------------------- OLED --------------------
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 // OLED display width, in pixels
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 32 // OLED display height, in pixels
#define OLED_RESET     -1 // Reset pin # (or -1 if sharing Arduino reset pin)
#define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3C // < See datasheet for Address; 0x3D for 128x64, 0x3C for 128x32
Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

char peakString[8];

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    // SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC = generate display voltage from 3.3V internally
    if(!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, SCREEN_ADDRESS)) {
      Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
      for(;;); // Don't proceed, loop forever
    }

    // Clear the buffer
    display.clearDisplay();
 
    sampling_period_us = round(1000000*(1.0/SAMPLING_FREQUENCY));
}
 
void loop() {
   
    /*SAMPLING*/
    for(int i=0; i<SAMPLES; i++)
    {
        microseconds = micros();    //Overflows after around 70 minutes!
     
        vReal[i] = analogRead(0);
        vImag[i] = 0;
     
        while(micros() < (microseconds + sampling_period_us)){ }
    }
 
    /*FFT*/
    FFT.Windowing(vReal, SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);
    FFT.Compute(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES, FFT_FORWARD);
    FFT.ComplexToMagnitude(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES);
    double peak = FFT.MajorPeak(vReal, SAMPLES, SAMPLING_FREQUENCY);
 
    /*PRINT RESULTS*/
    //Serial.println(peak);     //Print out what frequency is the most dominant.

    vReal[0] = 0;
    vReal[1] = 0;
    
    for(int i=0; i<(SAMPLES/2); i++)
    {
        /*View all these three lines in serial terminal to see which frequencies has which amplitudes*/
         
        //Serial.print((i * 1.0 * SAMPLING_FREQUENCY) / SAMPLES, 1);
        //Serial.print(" ");
        Serial.println(vReal[i], 1);    //View only this line in serial plotter to visualize the bins
    }

    dtostrf(peak, 6, 2, peakString);
    display.clearDisplay();
    display.setCursor(10, 0);
    display.setTextSize(3);
    display.setTextColor(SSD1306_WHITE); // Draw white text
    display.write(peakString);
    display.display();
 
    delay(1);
    //while(1);       //Run code once
}
```

# frequencies --> notes 
now i just need to translate frequencies to notes for human readbility - i then wrote this function:
```arduino
float frequencies[] { 130.8, 138.6, 146.8, 155.6, 164.8, 174.6, 185.0, 196.0, 207.7, 220.0, 232.2, 247.0 };
String notes[] { "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B" };
int freqLength = sizeof frequencies / sizeof frequencies[0];

...

String findFrequency(float freq) {
  int closestIndex = 0;
  double diff = frequencies[closestIndex];
  
  for (int i=0; i<freqLength; i++) {
    diff = min(abs(frequencies[i]-freq), diff);
    if (diff == abs(frequencies[i]-freq)) {
      closestIndex = i;
    }
  }
  return notes[closestIndex];
}
```
it loops through an array of frequencies and their notes, and matches the current frequency to the nearest one.

# connecting an RGB LED
after being able to have frequency and note data available, the next step was to make it go bling bling âœ¨ 

i connected an RGB LED (with common anode) to the arduino (pins: R=>6, G=>5, B=>3), but ironically enough i decided against mapping frequency values to the RGB color scheme.

the reason for this is because HSL is much more suited for this applciation, imo. i wanted to map the frequency range from (C to B), to a continuous color scale, and that's what HSL can provide using the color wheel.

![hsl color wheel](/static/arduino-visualiser/hsl-color-wheel.png)

instead of changing R, G and B values independently, i could map the frequencies from 0 to 360 on the color wheel! so my idea was to map the frequencies to an HSL color, and convert it to RGB from there. 
i found [this awesome color converting library on github](https://github.com/ratkins/RGBConverter), so i copied over its function and tweaked it a little, so now my code looks like:
```arduino
// -------------------- FFT SETUP --------------------
#include "arduinoFFT.h" 
#define SAMPLES 64             //Must be a power of 2
#define SAMPLING_FREQUENCY 1000 //Hz, must be less than 10000 due to ADC
 
arduinoFFT FFT = arduinoFFT();
 
unsigned int sampling_period_us;
unsigned long microseconds;
 
double vReal[SAMPLES];
double vImag[SAMPLES];

# adding more stuff
the project's almost done now - but i think there was room for improvement.

although one RGB LED is easy to work with, but maybe not the prettiest ðŸ‘€ because I had a WS2812B LED strip lying around, i decided to use that in addition to the RGB LED. i won't talk about how i programmed them though, but the code would be availlable on my github :3
![led strip](/static/arduino-visualiser/led-strip.jpg)

i also wanted the project to be portable, like a mini lamp - so i had to add a power source too. i went with a micro USB port and a barrel jack, connected to a 5V DC-DC stepdown to provide stable 5V to the project.

the final schematic looked like this:
![schematic](/static/arduino-visualiser/schematic.png)

# the enclosure
so it works now but it looks terrible!!! everything just lives on my breadboard. 

after some thought, i decided to go with a sussy crewmate model, because why not - the LED would pop up on its head and an OLED on its glasses would display which frequency it's currently hearing.

i came up with this 3d model to be printed:
![side1](/static/arduino-visualiser/side1.png)
![side2](/static/arduino-visualiser/side2.png)

unfortunately i had to switch to a smaller microcontroller, because the UNO could not fit in this enclosure. i settled on a NodeMCU, because not only is it smaller but also has better specs too (80MHz clock speed, ~80kb) compared to the Arduino UNO (16MHz, ~2kb)
![nodemcu](/static/arduino-visualiser/nodemcu.jpg)

# the assembly
in theory, i would have just soldered everything using wires and fitted them nicely into the enclosure, and the project would have been completed. 

but i was too naive ðŸ˜­

i realised i had the power hole too small, and I had to sand it down to make the opening bigger so i could put both the microusb and barrel jack together. 

also, due to my lack of forseeing the actual project assembly, it was very hard to fit the project together - the body was one rigid shell, and getting all the components in all of their right places took a lot of patience and sanity from me.

not only that, when i was soldering the project together, i cut some corners and used very short wires. don't be like me. use longer wires. you'll thank yourself later.

and my last shortcoming was my stupidity. i thought i didn't need mounting holes because hot glue would do the trick, but it didn't work out the way i expected it. the OLED display was stressful to attach with hot glue, and so were the barrel jack and micro usb. 

nevertheless, i overcame all these difficulties in the end. it took about an afternoon of soldering and hot glueing, and i was satisfied with how it turned out:
![exterior](/static/arduino-visualiser/exterior.jpg)

this is how it looks inside:
![interior](/static/arduino-visualiser/interior.jpg)
(yes, its atrocious i know)

demo gif:
![demo](/static/arduino-visualiser/demo.gif)

# footnote
even though it wasn't perfect, i learned a lot while making this project. after all, nothing's perfect anyways ðŸ˜Ž 

things i've learned
- think every detail through (yes it looks good, but is it a practical thing to add/remove?)
- add mounting holes next time
- once you have an idea, don't sit on it for too long or you'll forget about it and lose novelty

the code / edited 3d model can be found over at my github: https://github.com/Fogeinator/sussy-lamp

i'll keep updating the code though. i'll be adding more LED strip patterns, and since im using nodemcu, i'll add OTA support too.
(OTA = over the air, basically wireless code uploading)

anyways, this was my first devlog blog post. it's not meant to be a guide for those who want to build along, but rather a personal diary so i can reflect back on my dumbness in the future.

should i write a tutorial blog post for people who actually want to build this project? what would you like to see next? let me know on discord/twitter/anywhere I am! i would love to hear any feeedback :3

that's all for now, thanks for reading! ðŸ’–
